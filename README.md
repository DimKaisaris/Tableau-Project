# Tableau-Project

## Project overview:
Explored the Superstore Sales dataset using Tableau and created a dashboard to showcase key insights.
Utilized various chart types including bar graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots to visually represent data 
and highlight trends. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales by region, product category, 
and shipping method, allowing for easy identification of top performers and opportunities for improvement.
