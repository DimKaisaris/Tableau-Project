# Tableau-Project

## Project overview:
Exploring the Superstore Sales dataset using Tableau and created a dashboard to showcase key insights.  
Utilized various chart types including bar graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots to visually represent data   
and highlight trends. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales by region, product category,   
and shipping method, allowing for easy identification of top performers and opportunities for improvement.

## First Page
Created a bar chart to visualize the profit by product category and subcategory. Utilized a hierarchy  
to group subcategories under respective categories, resulting in a more organized and intuitive representation  
of data. The chart provides a clear picture of profit distribution across categories and subcategories,  
highlighting areas of success and potential for improvement.
